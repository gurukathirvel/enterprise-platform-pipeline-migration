# Security and Governance

## Identity & Access Management
- Role-based access control
- Least privilege policies
- Separation of duties between teams

## Secrets Management
- AWS Secrets Manager / Azure Key Vault
- No secrets stored in pipelines or code

## Security Scanning
- IaC scanning (tfsec, Checkov)
- Container image scanning (Trivy)
- Dependency vulnerability checks

## Compliance & Audit
- Centralized audit logging
- Immutable pipeline definitions
- Policy-as-code enforcement

Security is embedded into the platform, not bolted on.
