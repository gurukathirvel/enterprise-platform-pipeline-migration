# Current State Problems

## CI/CD Challenges
- Classic pipelines defined via UI
- No version control for pipeline logic
- Manual approvals without audit trail
- Secrets stored as pipeline variables

## Infrastructure Challenges
- Inconsistent infrastructure provisioning
- Environment drift between dev, non-prod, and prod
- Manual changes bypassing IaC

## Security Gaps
- Limited IaC security scanning
- Late detection of misconfigurations
- Inconsistent IAM and RBAC patterns

## Operational Impact
- Slow delivery cycles
- High operational risk
- Difficult compliance audits
